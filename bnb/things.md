[Â« Back to index](/bnb)

## [Bombs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/bomb)

> As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage.

* The party found a few of these on a hobgoblin involved in the robbery of the Lowtown branch of FITH. Looks like they had backups.

## Mysterious scrolls

> This scroll contains a magical word that, when recited aloud, causes _strange things_ to happen to its reader.

* The Clam purchased this scroll from a junkmonger in Lowtown Market. Upon reciting the word inside, he emitted a bright light for a short period of time, blinding his allies and gaining the attention of everyone in the market.
* The Clam purchased a similar scroll from a pawn shop in Lowtown.

## Mysterious bag of salts

> A small, vile-smelling pouch of of salts. May induce vomiting in anyone who partakes in its flavorful aroma.

* The party found a small pouch of these salts hidden in a chest in a room at the Smarmy Marmot.

## [Scimitar of Speed](https://open5e.com/equipment/magic-items/scimitar-of-speed.html)

> You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.

* The party uncovered this item in a secret room in an old armory underneath the Smarmy Marmot.

## [Immovable Rod](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Immovable%20Rod#content)

> This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn't move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success

* The party found this holding a door shut in the tunnels underneath the Smarmy Marmot. Seems awfully advanced for goblins.

## Nova Lux

> This longsword (1d8 slashing damage, versatile) has been enhanced with experimental magic to aid in the fight against the undead.
> * Because the magic in this weapon is unstable, the wielder must make a DC 12 DEX save on each turn while the weapon is wielded. On a failed save, the wielder takes **1d4 shock damage**. However, this check can be avoided if the wielder is wearing hand protection, such as insulated gloves.
> * Once per long rest, you can speak the sword's name to cause it to emit a bright blue light, which **pierces darkness for 60 feet and magical darkness for 10 feet for 1 minute**.
> * Creatures must make a DC 12 DEX save when hit by this weapon. If the creature fails this save, the sword deals an **extra 1d8 shock damage**. Undead creatures cannot save from this damage.

* The party found this sword next to a backpack containing rotten food in the tunnels underneath the Smarmy Marmot. It was laying next to a scrawled wooden sign that read "in case he sees you".

## [Cloak of Displacement](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cloak%20of%20Displacement#content)

> _Requires attunement._ While you wear this cloak, it projects an Illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on Attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are Incapacitated, Restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

* The wight in the tunnels underneath the Smarmy Marmot was wearing this cape. He is no longer wearing this cape.

## Pouch of wight dust

> A small pouch containing a portion of the remains of an undead spectre that were left behind after its defeat. Not recommended for seasoning most foods.

* You-know-who dropped turned into dust after his defeat in the tunnels underneath the Smarmy Marmot. Klestra seemed keen on taking this with him.
