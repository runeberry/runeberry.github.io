## [Chip's Tribute](CHIPS/)

At one point, I attempted to recreate the Windows 95 version of Chip's Challenge in JavaScript, entirely playable in a web browser. I didn't finish, but what's there is playable. Maybe I'll revisit this someday?

## [Wox.Plugin.RuneScapeWiki](https://github.com/dolphinspired/Wox.Plugin.RuneScapeWiki)

I found myself googling Old School RuneScape stuff all the time while playing, so I decided to speed up the process with a Wox plugin. Search from your desktop, find your result, and hit Enter. Practically zero XP wasted.
